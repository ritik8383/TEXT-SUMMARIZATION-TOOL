# Description
The first task of the CodTech Internship focuses on building a Text Summarization Tool using advanced techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This tool is intended to automatically shorten long pieces of text such as articles, research papers, blog posts, or reports into concise and meaningful summaries without losing the key information. In an age where information overload is a significant challenge, such tools are extremely valuable in making content more digestible and time-efficient.
Objective of the Task
The goal is to design a Python-based application that takes a long passage or article as input and returns a summarized version of it. The summarization should retain the important facts, ideas, and overall essence of the original text. This task will give interns practical exposure to real-world NLP applications, particularly in the domain of automatic text summarization—a growing field in AI, journalism, education, and research.
Key Requirements
Tool Development: Interns are required to develop a working tool or Python script that performs summarization.
NLP Integration: The script must utilize NLP techniques such as tokenization, word frequency analysis, and sentence ranking (for extractive summarization), or transformer-based models (for abstractive summarization).
Deliverable Format: The final submission should be a Python script (.py) that takes an input text and returns a clean, accurate summary.
Types of Summarization
There are two main types of text summarization that can be implemented:
1. Extractive Summarization:
Selects and extracts the most important sentences from the original text.
Common algorithms: TextRank, Luhn’s method, LexRank.
Easier to implement and doesn’t require deep learning models.
Tools/libraries: NLTK, spaCy, Sumy, Gensim.
2. Abstractive Summarization:
Generates new sentences that convey the same meaning using natural language understanding.
Requires deep learning and transformer models.
Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers, T5, BART, GPT.
Interns may choose either approach depending on their comfort level and available resources.
Learning Outcomes
This task allows interns to:
Understand the fundamentals of NLP.
Learn how to process and clean text data.
Apply pre-trained models and algorithms for summarization.
Practice coding in Python for real-world AI/ML applications.
Improve skills in libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or transformers.
Example Workflow
1. Input: A lengthy article (can be a string or a .txt file).
2. Processing:
Tokenize the article into sentences and words.
Apply frequency-based scoring or use a pre-trained transformer model.
Select or generate sentences that best summarize the article.
